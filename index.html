// this code is awful but also lovely? i definitely couldve done it better but its kind of beautiful in its own messed up and clunky way.

              <p>im taking the jokey lore about the aviator, the privateer, glib, and the one scav i use for everything and making it actual character lore. the jokey lore is that the aviator dimension hops randomly via vehicle crashes... which is going to translate into the beginning of an "is this an isekai?" story with a character (creatively) named avi. avi is gonna meet the bagel (aka the privateer), glib, and plexiem (the scav i use for everything). plexiem can randomly time travel whenever he "dies" and will wake up at a random point in time in the dimension hes in. they go off and do wacky adventures and maybe i have a plot in mind. im gonna do some character redesigns based off of my rain world ocs but my ocs will still exist. theyre just gonna see a different, less fandomy, version of their gang. there may or may not be some surrealist webcore themes included.</p>

              <p>saint really is a tribute to movement and the feeling of your first playthrough. you cant fight back (unless specific circumstances are met) and you are equipped with a grappling tongue. so many combinations can be made and will be made in the heat of the moment. the smooth swinging transitioning into a roll, then a pounce, and back into a swing again as you flee from a red lizard. nearly falling to your death to then, at the last second, attach to the nearest surface and be flung upwards. saint is momentum.</p>
