    <p>ignore the domain name and what i put in the description, this isnt rain world oc centric. i mean, expect to see them a bit but this isnt exclusively rain world stuff.<br>you might be asking "so why is the domain name the name of the rain world oc thing?". i told you to ignore that. kidding! thats a good question.<br>i didnt feel like making a new github account and github is a free website hosting service i trust. so yeah. this is also a personal website now.</p>

    <p>yet another nonbinary digital artist! i draw creatures and guys. usually in angsty situations, but sometimes being silly. i used to do minecraft youtube. if you scroll down on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@probably_creek">my channel</a> you can find it.<br>i am highly aware that im cringe or whatever but im having fun so i count it as a win. i like coding, hitting people with swords (up to you to decide if theyre real swords or fake swords), writing, composing music, and other things.<br> i should probably become a game developer. but im tired.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>happy holidays :D</p><br>

        <p>why am i getting hyped up over a low quality joke about miros birds? /j<br><br>in all seriousness, thank you for the hyping up. it means a lot. my brain isnt used to proccessing this amount of serotonin.<br>i apologize for the violently terrible placement errors on desktop, patches to come soon</p>

    <p>i built this website up from the ground minus the <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">main css framework</a> i used and the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp">flexbox tutorial</a> because css that makes the site actually function is not something i can do in the fleeting free moments of school.</p>

  <p><u>i also want to clear up something before it becomes an issue or a concern:</u><br><br> i draw angst, violence, blood, and the like because i was a warrior cats kid. ive basically been coded to draw my favorite guys being dramatic/fighting/exploding things.<br> its not because i have issues or condone real violence. its because its a topic ive been hooked on. also, a lot of the time i dont agree with the actions of the characters i depict or play. please do not mix up artist/actor and character. i wince when a fly is killed, slugcat rain world eats flies.</p>
