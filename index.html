                wawa -- idk could mean anything depending on context, but its a fan term for the noises slugcats make<br>
                plate tectonically -- silly way of saying platonically<br>

              <p>im taking the jokey lore about the aviator, the privateer, glib, and the one scav i use for everything and making it actual character lore. the jokey lore is that the aviator dimension hops randomly via vehicle crashes... which is going to translate into the beginning of an "is this an isekai?" story with a character (creatively) named avi. avi is gonna meet the privateer (idk the new name yet), glib, and plexiem (the scav i use for everything). plexiem can randomly time travel whenever he "dies" and will wake up at a random point in time in the dimension hes in. they go off and do wacky adventures and maybe i have a plot in mind. im gonna do some character redesigns based off of my rain world ocs but my ocs will still exist. theyre just gonna see a different, less fandomy, version of their gang. there may or may not be some surrealist webcore themes included.</p>

              <p>saint really is a tribute to movement and the feeling of your first playthrough. you cant fight back (unless specific circumstances are met) and you are equipped with a grappling tongue. so many combinations can be made and will be made in the heat of the moment. the smooth swinging transitioning into a roll, then a pounce, and back into a swing again as you flee from a red lizard. nearly falling to your death to then, at the last second, attach to the nearest surface and be flung upwards. saint is momentum.</p>

  it can make images faster and better than we can. it can animate. but whats the point? if we automate everything, including being creative, what is the point? this is our last tower, our last stance of being superior before we realize we are useless. ai can reuse everything, it has a near infinite source of things to scrape and sample from. it can output "unique concepts" without the thought behind it faster than i can with the thought behind it. <br>ai means we, as homo sapiens, are not special anymore on our planet. we are inferior to something and its scary. art is a way of taking control but its bleeding into that and we cant stop it.<br>there is no point once we automate creation and innovation. i mean "eat", "drink", "type prompt" seem to be the future of things we have to do. and who knows? maybe that will be automated. we just consume. but there is no point in it. just observing empty images makes empty people. we need to create. ai takes that away. its not for artists, its for people who just want to see a pretty picture.
